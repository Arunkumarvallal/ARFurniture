It also helps them get a visual sense of what the room will look like with the new furniture added. Since the image is in 3D, the customer can walk around it to see it from different perspectives which also helps with the customer’s decision-making. When it comes to retailers, they can display their products visually and interactively using AR tools. 


With an AR app, people can place a bookshelf in their rooms using only a few taps on a phone. In other words, they could visualize how a sofa would look in brown or red color. The risk of product-return and logistical expenses will be minimized. The application offers an immersive preview of the furniture, customizable to the spatial real world.
